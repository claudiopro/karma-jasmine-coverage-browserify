# karma-jasmine-coverage-browserify
Karma with Jasmine, Browserify and coverage boilerplate

This project represents the minimum configuration necessary to run tests with Karma,
Browserify and Istanbul. According to `karma-coverage`'s [Issue 16](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-coverage/issues/16#issuecomment-62091196),
`browserify-istanbul` must be used to play nice with other `browserify` transforms,
while `karma-coverage` would not work with this configuration.
